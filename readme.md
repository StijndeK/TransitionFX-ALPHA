# TRANSITION FX

Transition FX is a synthesiser optimalised for creating transitional moving effects such as whooshes, risers and stingers. 
As a composer and sound design for media, I use a lot of moving transitional effects such as whooshes, risers and stingers. These effects can consist of samples and/or synthesis. I found that there was a lack of a intuitive synthesiser that is optimalised for these effects, which is why I started developing Transition FX.

```diff
- TFX is still under development, none of the current features are final.
